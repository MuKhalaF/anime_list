    desciption:
        "Gon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also, he is not very good at math. However, having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals. Gon is an Enhancer, who are known for being simple-minded and determined. This determination and talent lead to both potential allies and potential enemies trusting in him and taking his side. He has inhuman senses; Gon has a heightened sense of smell almost like a dog's, he also has very good vision, as well as having a very keen taste. Gon wants to become a Hunter because he wishes to find out the depths of an occupation that would cause a father to choose the profession over being with his own son.",

Showing great promise from birth, Killua followed the traditional Zoldyck training, which was imparted to him by Silva and Illumi.[7] He had already mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and was set to be one of the best assassins the family had ever produced.[8] At the age of three, he started training in tailing that routinely put his life at risk",

    desciption:
        "Kurapika was born to the Kurta Clan in a secluded forest in the Lukso Province. As a child, he almost fell from a cliff but was saved by his best friend, Pairo. While he was unharmed, his friend Pairo had harmed both his legs and eyes, their condition worsening every day. Kurapika felt responsible for the incident and resolved to leave the forest and search the outside world for a doctor who could cure Pairo. Kurapika thus approached the Kurta Clan's elder several times to request to go to the outside world, but he was constantly refused. This sparked a long-lasting debate between the two, with Kurapika perceiving the Kurta Clan's fear of the outside world as unreasonable and backward. After one such argument, he talked to Pairo and discovered that people outside of the Kurta Clan do not have Scarlet Eyes, which caused their clan to be persecuted",

    title: "Leorio Paradinight",
    desciption:
        "Leorio once lost a close friend (a boy named Pietro in the 1999 anime adaptation) to a debilitating illness. Leorio feels deeply remorseful about being unable to save his friend, as the illness was entirely curable but required a surgery he could not afford. Thus, he aspires to become a doctor—one who not only cures the ill of their diseases, but also one who works pro-bono for people who cannot afford it. In this light, his outwardly superficial reason to join the Hunter Exams in the pursuit of great wealth gains a more noble justification—the money he earns is used not only to fund his medical school fees but also to pay for the medicine and other miscellaneous expenditures when treating those who can not afford it",

    title: "Hisoka Morow",
    desciption:
        "Hisoka is portrayed as entirely self-serving, self-absorbed, and selfish; he does whatever he likes as long as it pleases him in some way. His insatiable love for spilling the blood of powerful fighters in combat and his enjoyment of extreme pain while doing so fuels his seemingly sadomasochistic desires. In order for them to grow to their full potential (so as to improve the pleasure of killing them later), Hisoka allows the main protagonists to live in situations wherein he is easily able to kill them. Likewise, he grows excited to meet new people he deems worthy of fighting or anyone with the potential to be a good fighter and entertain him in the future. The thrill of fighting strong Nen users in tactical battles and near-death experiences is an orgasmic experience for him. It is likely one of the reasons why he goes out of his way to find new toys to play with. If they break, he either loses interest or kills them before going out to find more potential prey.",

    desciption:
        "The circumstances in which Netero became a Hunter and learned Nen are unknown. His proficiency was such that it earned him the title of most powerful Nen user in the world. At some point in his life, he fought Maha Zoldyck and became an acquaintance of the Zoldyck Family.[14] Netero training in the mountains Netero was trained in martial arts and, at the age of 46, during the winter, he believed that he had reached the pinnacle of his physical potential and went up into the mountains to reflect. During his time there, he came to the realization that was infinitely grateful to the martial arts for making him the man he was and vowed that he would show his gratitude in his own unique way, by doing a set of ten thousand punches and prayers daily. He would focus his chi, put his hands together, say a prayer, and then punch. On the first day, this sequence took five to six seconds, and it took him over eighteen hours to complete the ten thousand punches. After completing the ritual, he would collapse from exhaustion and fall into a deep sleep, only to awaken and repeat the ten thousand punches the next day. This would become Netero's daily routine for the next two years.",

    title: "Biscuit Krueger",
    desciption:
        "Biscuit has a devious personality. She has a tendency to use her cutesy appearance and demeanor to her advantage, whether it is for gathering information, getting what she wants, or acting innocent and helpless in combat to deceive her opponents. She jokingly said that if someone insists on using an honorific, they must call her -chama (-chan + -sama). Though in the beginning she was out to destroy Gon and Killua's friendship for fun, at the end of Greed Island she acknowledges that she is close to developing parental feelings toward the two of them. She is prone to violent outbursts whenever she is left out of a conversation or reminded of her true age; Killua often becomes one of her victims because of his wisecracks about it. She can also get into arguments with people whose personalities differ from her own, such as Kurapika. Despite her sternness and deceitful personality, Biscuit is easily persuaded once someone compliments her appearance; when Kurapika acknowledges her looking like a princess, Biscuit immediately becomes flattered and agreeable.[5] On the other hand, despite her hard training to reach it, she detests her true form, as it does not match her idea of femininity.",

        "Ging is the only grandson of Gon's great-grandmother. He and Mito are cousins. Ging left Whale Island to take the 267th Hunter Exam not long before turning 12. Right after his departure, Mito's parents died in an accident while on vacation, and his own father was lost at sea.[1] He was the only examinee to pass the 267th Hunter Exam.[2] Ging returned to Whale Island ten years afterwards with a two-year-old Gon. He intended to leave Gon with his grandmother for a while, telling her that he and Gon's mother had separated.[1] However, Mito thought that he wasn’t fit to take care of Gon and got custody. After becoming a licensed Hunter, Ging devoted himself to the excavation and preservation of archaeological ruins. He used his own fortune to preserve and restore ruins so that everyone could see them. His achievements are now considered an exemplary model on archeological management throughout the world.",
